\title{Download and set the path to HYDAT}
\usage{
download_hydat(dl_hydat_here = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dl_hydat_here}{Directory to the HYDAT database. The path is chosen by the \code{rappdirs} package and is OS specific and can be view by \code{rappdirs::user_data_dir}. 
This path is also supplied automatically to any function that uses the HYDAT database. A user specified path can be set though this is not the advised approach.}
}
\description{
Download the HYDAT sqlite database. This database contains all the historical hydrometric data for Canada's integrated hydrometric network.
The function will check for a existing sqlite file and won't download the file if the same version is already present. 
\code{download_hydat} also looks to see if you have the HYDAT environmental variable set.
