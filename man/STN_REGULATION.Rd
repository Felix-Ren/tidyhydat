\usage{
STN_REGULATION(hydat_path = NULL, STATION_NUMBER = NULL,
  PROV_TERR_STATE_LOC = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{hydat_path}{Directory to the hydat database. Can be set as "Hydat.sqlite3" which will look for Hydat in the working directory.
The hydat path can also be set in the \code{.Renviron} file so that it doesn't have to specified every function call. The path should
set as the variable \code{hydat}. Open the \code{.Renviron} file using this command: \code{file.edit("~/.Renviron")}.}

\item{STATION_NUMBER}{Water Survey of Canada station number. If this argument is omitted from the function call, the value of \code{PROV_TERR_STATE_LOC}
is returned.}

\item{PROV_TERR_STATE_LOC}{Province, state or territory. If this argument is omitted from the function call, the value of \code{STATION_NUMBER}
is returned. See \code{unique(STATIONS(hydat_path = "H:/Hydat.sqlite3")$PROV_TERR_STATE_LOC)}}
}
\value{
A tibble of stations, years of regulation and the regulation status

\description{
Provides wrapper to turn the STN_REGULATION table in HYDAT into a tidy data frame. \code{STATION_NUMBER} and
\code{PROV_TERR_STATE_LOC} can both be supplied. If both are omitted all values from the \code{STATIONS} table are returned
}
