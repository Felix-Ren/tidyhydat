\description{
Download realtime discharge data from the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) datamart. The function will prioritize
downloading data collected at the highest resolution. In instances where data is not available at high (hourly or higher) resolution
daily averages are used. Currently, if a station does not exist or is not found, no data is returned.

## Download from multiple provinces
realtime_dd(station_number=c("01CD005","08MF005"))
