## Project Status

This package is under active development. The package is currently undergoing a review by [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/). You can see the progress of this review here: https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/152. As a result breaking changes to `tidyhydat` functions will be made. To install the most recent version prior to these changes you can use this command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("bcgov/tidyhydat@v0.2.9")
```
However, you should strongly consider migrating to the updated `tidyhydat` once the review process is complete. 

## What does it do?

Here is a list of what `tidyhydat` does:
  
- Provide function that access each table in the HYDAT database and return tidy data.
- Keep functions as low-level as possible. For example, for daily flows, the `DLY_FLOWS()` function queries the database, *tidies* the data and returns the data. 
- Provide functions that access Environment and Climate Change Canada's real-time hydrometric data source. 
- Provide functions that search full station lists and aid in generating station vectors
  
A more thorough vignette outlining the full functionality of `tidyhydat` is outlined [here](https://github.com/bcgov/tidyhydat/blob/master/vignettes/tidyhydat.Rmd)
  
## Installation
To install the `tidyhydat` package, you need to install the `devtools` package then the `tidyhydat` package
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bcgov/tidyhydat")
```
  
Then to load the package you need to using the `library()` function. When you install `tidyhydat`, several other packages will be installed as well. One of those packages, `dplyr`, is useful for data manipulations and is used regularly here. Even though `dplyr` is installed alongside `tidyhydat`, it is helpful to load it by itself as there are many useful functions contained within `dplyr`. A helpful `dplyr` tutorial can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html).
  
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warnig=FALSE}
library(tidyhydat)
library(dplyr)
```
  
### HYDAT download
To use most of the `tidyhydat` package you will need to download a version of the HYDAT database, Environment and Climate Change Canada's comprehensive database of historical hydrometric data then tell R where to find the database. `tidyhydat` does all this for you via:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
download_hydat()
```
This downloads the most recent version of HYDAT and then saves it in a location on your computer where `tidyhydat`'s function will look for it. Do be patient though as this takes a long time! To see where HYDAT was saved you can run `rappdirs::site_data_dir()`.
  
## Usage

### HYDAT functions
Now that you have HYDAT downloaded and ready to go, you are all set to begin some hydrologic analysis. The following functions follow a common argument structure which can be illustrated with the `hy_daily_flows()` function. If you would like to extract only station `08LA001` you can supply the `station_number`. 
  
```{r example1, warning=FALSE}
hy_daily_flows(station_number = "08LA001")
```

If you would instead prefer all stations from a province, you can use the `prov_terr_state_loc` argument and omit the `station_number` argument:
  
```{r example2, warning=FALSE}
hy_daily_flows(prov_terr_state_loc = "PE")
```

### Real-time
To download real-time data using the datamart we can use approximately the same conventions discussed above. Using `realtime_dd()` we can easily select specific stations by supplying a station of interest:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
realtime_dd(station_number = "08LG006")
```
Another option is to provide simply the province as an argument and download all stations from that province:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
realtime_dd(prov_terr_state_loc = "PE")
```
Additionally `download_realtime_ws()` provides another means of acquiring real time data though that requires a username and password from Environment and Climate Change Canada.

### Search functions
You can also make use of auxiliary functions in `tidyhydat` called `search_stn_name()` and `search_stn_number()` to look for matches when you know part of a name of a station. For example:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
search_stn_name("liard")
```
Similarly, `search_stn_number()` can be useful if you are interested in all stations from the *08MF* sub-sub-drainage:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
search_stn_number("08MF")
```
