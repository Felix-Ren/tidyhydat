# tidyhydat

Here is a list of what tidyhydat does:
- Perform a number of common queries on the HYDAT database and returns a tibble
- Maintains column names as the database itself
- Can select one, two... x stations
- Keep functions are low-level as possible. For example, for daily flows, the function should query the database then format the dates and that is it. 


## Example

This is a basic example of `tidyhydat` usage

```{r example}
library(tidyhydat)

DLY_FLOWS(STATION_NUMBER = c("08LA001","08LG006"))

```
